# cordova-plugin-integrity

This plugin allows an app to perform an integrity check on itself and on the host system.
Integrity checks guarantee that the genuine app is used on an approved system, e.g., a non-rooted unmodified smartphone.
The plugin provide a common interface to the [Android Play Integrity](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) and the [Apple iOS DeviceCheck](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck) providing integrity checks.
